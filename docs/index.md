A Mathematica package for computing quasinormal mode solutions of the Teukolsky equation in Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetime. The package introduces two new functions:
```Mathematica
QNMFrequency[s, l, m, n, a]
QNMRadial[s, l, m, n, a]
```
where  
$s$ - is the spin-weight of the field  
$l$ - is the multipolar index  
$m$ - is the azimuthal index  
$n$ - is the overtone number  
$a$ - is the black hole spin parameter

### Further examples

Additional documentation can be found in the Mathematica documentation included with the package.
